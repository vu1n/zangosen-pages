### Story 1: Normalize Identifying Corporate Devices in Your Software
[Read Article](https://lgug2z.com/articles/normalize-identifying-corporate-devices-in-your-software/)

**Key Takeaways:**
1. The article presents methods to identify corporate devices via MDM enrollment status on macOS and Windows.
2. It emphasizes contributing to a directory of corporate MDM server URLs for better accuracy.
3. The approach aims to improve license compliance monitoring for dual-licensed software.
4. Detection mechanisms should be transparent to avoid user distrust.
5. The conversation includes the complexity around dual licensing in open-source communities.

**Insightful Comments:**
- "Extremely poetic to use detection of the presence of corporate spyware as leverage for redistribution of wealth." - @ufrklw
- "If I noticed software doing this without clear disclosure, I'd find it suspicious." - @atjdu7
- "The purpose is open to implementation choices, from simple notices to complex tracking." - @mucnm8

**Risks/Caveats:**
- Users may distrust the detection methods unless transparently disclosed; may also trigger privacy concerns.
- Implementers must clearly define the purpose of identifying devices to avoid misinterpretation.

**Who should care & why:**
- Software developers with dual-licensed products; this method could ensure compliance without alienating users.

**TL;DR:**
A proposal for improving corporate device identification to enhance license compliance in dual-licensed software.
