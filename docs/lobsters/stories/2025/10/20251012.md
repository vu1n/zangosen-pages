## 1. Liquid Glass Is Cracked, and Usability Suffers in iOS 26
**[Read more](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/liquid-glass/)**

### Key Takeaways:
- iOS 26 introduces a "Liquid Glass" UI design that emphasizes aesthetics over functionality, leading to usability issues.
- Transparency effects obscure content, making text and UI elements less discoverable and legible, violating usability principles.
- Predictable interaction patterns are lost, as tap targets are crowded and controls behave unpredictably.
- Apple’s design changes may appeal to newcomers but frustrate long-time users familiar with older conventions.
- The heavy reliance on animation distracts from user content, suggesting that form takes precedence over function.

### Insightful Comments:
1. “Liquid Glass is just spectacle, at opposition to improvement. Let's hope Apple returns to good UI design.” – *wbeamd*
2. “The interface ripples and shimmers as if your phone were encased in Jell-O.” – *qxfgv1*, emphasizing the perception of design as distracting rather than enhancing.
3. “For many users, this design feels like a fogged-up window: pretty from a distance, but frustrating at close range.” – *original article summary*.

### Risks/Caveats:
- The new design could alienate existing users who prefer functional interfaces, leading to decreased customer satisfaction and retention.

### Who Should Care & Why:
- Mobile developers and UI/UX designers need to be aware of these usability pitfalls to create more user-friendly interfaces in future versions.

### TL;DR:
Apple's "Liquid Glass" design in iOS 26 prioritizes aesthetics but compromises usability, leading to user frustration.

## 3. HTML’s Best Kept Secret: The output Tag
**[Read more](http://denodell.com/blog/html-best-kept-secret-output-tag)**

### Key Takeaways:
- The `<output>` HTML element is underutilized and provides built-in accessibility advantages over traditional methods.
- It automatically informs assistive technologies when its content updates, improving user experience for those with disabilities.
- Despite being part of the HTML specification since 2008, it is rarely mentioned or used in developer resources.
- The element can be styled and is compatible with modern JavaScript frameworks, making it accessible for various web applications.
- Best practices for integrating the `<output>` element effectively into web applications are discussed.

### Insightful Comments:
1. “Coming from htmx, it’s easy to understand why the output tag has so few users. It does too little by default.” – *p16bvl*.
2. “Some screen readers have been found not to announce updates to the tag, so emphasizing the role attribute is worthwhile.” – *sq7bc6*.
3. “This tag could simplify dynamic result displays without relying on ARIA roles, which is a win for native HTML.” – *additional comment*.

### Risks/Caveats:
- The `<output>` tag doesn't provide significant functionality without JavaScript, which may discourage its use for more complex applications.

### Who Should Care & Why:
- Web developers focused on accessibility need to explore the `<output>` element to enhance usability across their applications.

### TL;DR:
The `<output>` tag is an underappreciated HTML feature that enhances accessibility, allowing for dynamic content updates with minimal extra coding.
