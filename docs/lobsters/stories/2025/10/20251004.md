## 1. Cancelling async Rust
### [Read here](https://sunshowers.io/posts/cancelling-async-rust/)
- Takeaways:
  - Discusses the complexities and challenges around cancellation in async Rust, emphasizing its unique handling of futures.
  - Provides examples to illustrate common pitfalls when implementing timeouts and cancellations in async code.
  - Introduces the concepts of cancel safety and cancel correctness, highlighting the importance of context in cancellation scenarios.
  - Offers practical advice for mitigating the risks of future cancellations, especially in systems with complex async operations.
  - Explains the need for better cancellation patterns and recommendations for structuring async tasks to avoid bugs.

- Insightful Comments:
  - "The issue with cancellation prompts non-local reasoning, which is often prone to bugs." — Commenter [yt5ze5](#)
  - "Using cancellation tokens could alleviate some issues but the language approach still needs more robust handling." — Commenter [v9jrh4](#)
  - "It's clear that as we scale our async systems, the reasoning about cancellation becomes harder; we need more structured protocols." — Commenter [hojf0q](#)

- Risks/Caveats:
  - Silent cancellations can lead to unintended data loss or state corruption.
  - Reasons for cancellations may not always be apparent, requiring careful code review and reasoning about futures.

- Who Should Care & Why:
  - Rust developers working with async programming will benefit from understanding these cancellation patterns to avoid common pitfalls.
  - System architects considering async architectures should grasp the implications of cancellation in event-driven systems.

- TL;DR:
  Async Rust’s cancellation mechanics are powerful, yet complex, requiring careful design to avoid critical bugs.

## 4. PEP 810: Explicit lazy imports
### [Read here](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-810-explicit-lazy-imports/104131)
- Takeaways:
  - PEP 810 proposes an opt-in lazy import syntax in Python, aimed at optimizing startup time and memory usage.
  - Highlights the relevance of lazy imports to improving performance without sacrificing code readability.
  - Involves collaboration among various companies and communities to arrive at a desirable syntax and semantics for this feature.
  - Suggests that lazy imports could provide developers with better control over module loading and related behaviors.
  - Discusses potential impacts of this feature on existing coding practices and the learning curve necessary to adopt the new syntax.

- Insightful Comments:
  - "This could really improve test suites; being able to defer imports can help with speed." — Commenter [azgy5k](#)
  - "I see potential issues with overusing lazy imports leading to chaos in code readability." — Commenter [rpqe1t](#)
  - "This proposal has a lot of merit, especially for large applications where import time can stall everything." — Commenter [ul9mkf](#)

- Risks/Caveats:
  - Lazy imports could introduce unpredictable behavior in dependency graphs, making code harder to reason about.
  - The burden of new syntax may initially confuse developers accustomed to eager loading.

- Who Should Care & Why:
  - Python developers focused on performance tuning for applications should watch PEP 810 as a significant improvement opportunity.
  - Community members concerned with dependency management could benefit from understanding how to structure imports effectively.

- TL;DR:
  PEP 810 introduces explicit lazy imports in Python, aimed at optimizing performance while keeping code semantics clear.
