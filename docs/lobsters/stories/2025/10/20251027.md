[Read more](https://maurycyz.com/misc/easy_git/)

### Key Takeaways
1. If you have a git repository on a server with SSH access, you can clone it directly to work locally and push changes back.
2. Git's `receive.denyCurrentBranch` setting can be adjusted to allow pushing to the currently checked-out branch, facilitating easier workflows.
3. Using git hooks can automate tasks such as updating a website after pushing changes to a git repository.
4. This approach is beneficial for syncing code across multiple computers and provides version control, which helps avoid accidental deletions.
5. It emphasizes the flexibility of using git directly on servers rather than relying solely on third-party services.

### Insights
- "Git is a DVCS, but people tend to forget the D." - @tlndsu
- "Good is the enemy of good enough. People should feel empowered to start with what they have first." - @9jurvc
- "Uhm, generally using checked-out repos for pushing is... quite bad and easily leaves the repo in an inconsistent state." - @0uqgze

### Risks/Caveats
- Working from a checked-out branch can lead to inconsistencies and is not recommended for complex projects.
- The method described might not scale well for larger teams or more complex workflows.

### Who Should Care & Why
- Developers looking for a lightweight method to manage small projects or personal codebases might find this useful, especially in environments where setting up a formal git server isn’t practical.

### TL;DR
You can create a functional git server using SSH without the need for complex setups or external hosting services.

## 2. You should feed the bots
[Read more](https://maurycyz.com/misc/the_cost_of_trash/)

### Key Takeaways
1. Serving low-value content (like junk data) to scrapers can be more cost-effective than blocking or limiting them.
2. Traditional approaches to blocking bots often fail as they can easily circumvent these defenses by changing IPs or user agents.
3. Automating protective measures, like using "garbage" content to deter scrapers, can reduce server load without sacrificing user experience.
4. The article outlines the rise of aggressive crawling by AI companies and the challenges they pose for independent web servers.
5. Techniques to minimize bandwidth usage and processing time while still handling bot traffic effectively are crucial for maintaining server health.

### Insights
- "It's actually much, much worse than that; most LLM companies are getting IPs from widely-deployed mobile malware." - @3xjsnn (comment referral)
- "I'm pro-AI, pro-LLM and even pro-crawling. But people who figure out how to slow down or impair these abusive crawlers are doing God's work." - @3kuvme
- "I used to do this pre-LLM explosion, but then these bots just bring your site to a halt crawling the garbage instead." - @xlpngc

### Risks/Caveats
- Feeding bots junk could lead to server issues if not managed well.
- Bandwidth implications from unnecessary traffic should be monitored to avoid costs.

### Who Should Care & Why
- Website operators and developers interested in emerging scrapping tactics and maintaining operational efficiency while minimizing server costs.

### TL;DR
Feeding scrapers junk data can save server resources better than trying to block them, but it must be managed carefully.
