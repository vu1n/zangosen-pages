## Open Source Developers Are Exhausted, Unpaid, and Ready to Walk Away
[Read Article](https://itsfoss.com/news/open-source-developers-are-exhausted/)

### Key Takeaways
1. **Burnout Crisis**: The open-source development community is facing significant burnout, with many developers feeling exhausted and undervalued.
2. **High Expectations**: OSS maintainers often juggle full-time jobs and their open-source commitments, leading to extreme workload and emotional drain.
3. **Toxic Community Behavior**: Many maintainers encounter toxic interactions, with users acting entitled and demanding features without recognizing the human effort involved.
4. **Calls for Change**: Recommendations include providing reliable payment structures for OSS developers and promoting better community behavior to mitigate burnout.
5. **Underrepresented Groups**: The report highlights that the majority of examined materials came from male developers, indicating potential gaps in understanding how burnout affects marginalized groups.

### Insightful Comments
- "I really wish a better mechanism existed for deciding who gets funding rather than 'whoever writes the best grants.'" - pslvq6
- "Companies profiting from OSS need to contribute financially at the very least. This dehumanization is a cultural issue within open-source." - 6zynpa
- "There are so many developers who treat FOSS as a hobby and wouldn't want to get paid for it." - uolufa

### Risks/Caveats
- **Potential Overgeneralization**: The narrative focuses on burnout but may overlook the diversity of motivations and experiences within the OSS community.
- **Funding Mechanisms**: The suggested solutions (e.g., reliable payments) could create new dependencies or issues if not implemented thoughtfully.

### Who Should Care & Why
- **Tech Companies**: Those that rely on OSS should consider how their practices impact developers and should adjust attitudes towards funding.
- **Software Developers**: Understanding this dynamic can lead to healthier team and community collaboration practices.

### TL;DR
Open-source developers are facing burnout due to unpaid work, toxic community interactions, and excessive workloads.
