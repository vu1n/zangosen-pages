## How good engineers write bad code at big companies
**URL**: [Read Here](https://www.seangoedecke.com/bad-code-at-big-companies/)

### 5 Key Takeaways:
1. **New Engineers**: Many code changes come from less experienced engineers, often working outside their expertise.
2. **Old Hands**: The presence of experienced engineers is not enough, as they face overload and company structures often undermine knowledge retention.
3. **Productivity vs. Quality**: Big tech companies prioritize rapid deployment over long-term software quality, leading to bad code being produced.
4. **Power Dynamics**: Engineers typically lack the agency to change these dynamics, exacerbating code quality issues.
5. **Imperfect Systems**: The text distinguishes between "pure" and "impure" engineering, suggesting that impure environments are more conducive to bad code due to various operational pressures.

### 3 Insightful Comment Points:
- **virywb**: "An outstanding observation that we can't just blame the engineers for the code quality - organizational dynamics play a huge role."
- **argtrc**: "Why are large tech companies making these inefficiencies? It seems counterproductive without considering the quality of their output."
- **glawav**: "While Sean's insights are valuable, I wish there was more discussion on optimism and potential improvements within these companies."

### Risks/Caveats:
- Claims may generalize experiences from individual companies which may not apply universally across all large tech firms.

### Who Should Care & Why:
- Software engineers and tech leaders will benefit from understanding the systemic roots of software quality issues to foster more productive environments.

### TL;DR:
Bad code at big companies stems from inexperienced employees introduced into complex systems lacking quality control mechanisms.
