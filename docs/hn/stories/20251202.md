        },
        {
          "author": "nickp",
          "point": "A key caution is that 'The context window is a bit of a misnomer... you're always getting better results by providing less context when possible, even with the long context window models,' suggesting that more concise prompting can still yield superior outcomes."
        },
        {
          "author": "pelle_f",
          "point": "Despite competitive pricing, '1M tokens of input can still cost tens of dollars quickly,' especially for multimodal applications where 'A few seconds of video, converted to images and text, could easily hit 1M tokens,' highlighting potential cost challenges for heavy media processing."
