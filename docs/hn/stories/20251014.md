      "Visual programming is experiencing a resurgence, driven by advancements in AI and the need for higher-level abstractions.",
      "AI is seen as a potential bridge, capable of generating code from visual designs and even interpreting complex diagrams.",
      "While effective for specific domains like UI/UX or game development, visual programming often struggles with general-purpose, abstract logic.",
      "Challenges include difficulties with version control (git diffs), debugging, and managing complexity when projects scale.",
