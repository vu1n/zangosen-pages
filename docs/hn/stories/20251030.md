      "Visual programming, once niche, is experiencing a renaissance, driven by AI, no-code/low-code platforms, and the need for more intuitive data flow management.",
      "Modern visual tools go beyond simple GUI builders; they enable advanced users to orchestrate complex workflows, especially in areas like game development, VFX, data pipelines, and AI prompt engineering.",
      "Benefits include faster iteration, reduced barriers to entry for non-programmers, improved debugging through visual representation, and a clearer understanding of system architecture and data flow.",
      "AI is both an enabler and a beneficiary, with AI models assisting in generating visual code from natural language and visual interfaces becoming crucial for designing and managing AI agents and their interactions.",
      "The future points to hybrid approaches where visual tools handle orchestration and high-level design, while textual code remains for low-level logic, allowing for greater abstraction and collaboration."
