      "\"It's remarkable how little has changed since 2015. The core problems of communication, scope, and expectations are timeless and still plague projects today.\" (hinkley)",
      "\"Many failures stem from 'marketing-driven development' where features are promised without technical understanding, leading to unsustainable death marches.\" (An anonymous commenter)",
      "\"The 'soft skills' – communication, empathy, negotiation – are often overlooked but are arguably more critical to project success than raw technical prowess.\" (An anonymous commenter)",
      "Disagreement noted: Some comments suggested that while these issues are persistent, the *tools* and *methodologies* for addressing them (e.g., Agile, DevOps) have evolved, but adoption and effective implementation remain challenging."

      "Most modern tech hardware, from smart TVs to phones, is increasingly designed to serve as a 'data funnel,' primarily for collecting user data to monetize through advertising or other means.",
      "Apple stands out by selling hardware first and foremost for its utility and user experience, with data collection being secondary and often user-controlled.",
      "Apple's business model relies on high-margin hardware sales and services, which reduces its incentive to extensively exploit user data compared to companies dependent on ad revenue.",
      "This privacy-centric approach is a core differentiator for Apple and appeals strongly to consumers concerned about digital privacy and data exploitation.",

      "Future shifts in Apple's business model (e.g., increased reliance on ad-supported services) could alter its privacy incentives.",
