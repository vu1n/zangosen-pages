*   **3 insightful comment points**:
    1.  **GPT-4 as a "Thought Partner"**: "I've started using GPT-4 less as a search engine and more as a rubber duck or thought partner. It forces me to articulate my problem clearly, which often helps me solve it even before seeing its output." (user_coder) This emphasizes the cognitive benefit of articulating thoughts for prompting, independent of the AI's response.
    2.  **The Skill of "Knowing What to Ask"**: "The real skill isn't just writing prompts, it's knowing *what* to ask. This means having domain expertise and critical thinking to evaluate the AI's output and guide it towards the correct answer." (ai_critic) This highlights that human expertise remains crucial for effective AI utilization and judgment.
    3.  **Cost and Context Window Management**: "10,000 prompts is great, but the cost quickly adds up for serious, long-term use. Also, managing the context window effectively for complex tasks is a constant battle; if you lose context, you lose quality." (prompt_engineer_guy) This brings up practical operational concerns around expense and the technical challenge of maintaining coherent long-form interactions with LLMs.

*   **Risks/caveats**: Potential for over-reliance on AI leading to reduced critical thinking or problem-solving skills; risk of propagating incorrect information due to hallucinations; high operational costs for extensive API usage; challenge of effectively managing context and prompt history for complex, multi-turn conversations.
